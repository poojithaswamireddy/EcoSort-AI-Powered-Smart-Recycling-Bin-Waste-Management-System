EcoSort is an innovative web application prototype designed to simulate an AI-powered smart recycling bin. Developed during our internship, its core goal is to address improper waste segregation by providing users with instant, AI-driven classification of waste items and clear guidance on correct disposal methods.

Our Role:
 As a team, we were responsible for the end-to-end development of this web prototype. This included designing the user interface, implementing frontend components using Next.js, React, and ShadCN, integrating AI functionalities for item identification and categorization using Genkit, enabling multilingual support (English, Hindi, Telugu) with voice assistance, and creating a conceptual sustainability dashboard with simulated data.

Outcomes Obtained: 
We successfully developed a functional prototype that demonstrates the core AI classification pipeline, offers a user-friendly and accessible interface, and showcases the potential of AI in improving recycling habits. The system can identify items from uploaded images or a live camera feed (simulated in the web app) and categorize them into streams like Dry Recyclable, Wet Organic, Hazardous, E-waste, or General Trash, providing users with immediate feedback and reasoning.
